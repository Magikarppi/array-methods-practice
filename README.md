## Prerequisites

- Some version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) 8.x.x

- install dependencies with command `npm i`

## Developing

1. Check what kind of output every function should have from `methods.test.js` file
2. Add your answers to `methods.js`

## Testing

To test if your answers are right run `npm t`

If you want to run one test at a time add `.only` after desired `test` function like this
```javascript
test.only('array of strings first name', () => {
  // something here
});
```
Then run `npm t` and it will run only that test
